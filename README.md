Classification Model for predicting football matches outcomes in Italian Serie

This project has been done in 4 days, during the Disruptive Data Summer School in Viterbo, Italy. The major objective was to deal with a large amount of data and manage to build from scratch our own model that makes the prediction of matches outcomes in Italian Serie A.
